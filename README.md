# How To Use It

1. Download the repo from GitHub
2. Change directory to "tensorflow-for-poets-2"
3. Install Python packages from the requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. To classify the image run the following command:
```
 python -m scripts.label_image     --graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb      --image=tf_files/to_check/04_06_2_004.jpg
```
This is the example of Neglyubka picture.
You can change the name of file to:
* 01_01_2_036.jpg (Gzhel)
* 01_02_2_039.jpg (Khlokhloma)
* 02_04_2_022.jpg (Wycinanki ≈Åowickie)
* 01_03_2_053.jpg (Gorodets)
* 02_07_2_012.jpg (Wzory Kaszubskie)
* 03_05_2_020.jpg (Iznik)

I prepared also some more pictures from Internet (you can find them in the folder "to_check")

# My Steps 

1. Forked and Cloned the repo TensorFlow For Poets from GitHub
2. Created new VirtualEnv and installed Tensorflow
3. Set variables:
  ``` 
  export IMAGE_SIZE=224
  export ARCHITECTURE="mobilenet_0.50_${IMAGE_SIZE}"
  ```
4. Downloaded the pictures from kaggle.com
5. Unpacked the pictures
6. Changed the format from png to jpg:  ```mogrify -format jpg *.png```
7. Prepared folders with one type pictures (Gzhel, Khokhloma, Gorodets, Wycinanki_lowickie, Wzory_kaszubskie, Iznik, Neglyubka)
8. From each file I chose one picture to test the model (folder "to_check") - I decided to choose only one picture from each folder because there are not many of them to teach the network. If I wanted to check another picture - I would download it from the Internet
9. Prepared three different models to teach the network:
   * pattern + product
   * pattern
   * product
10. Trained the network (with 500 training steps) and achieved the following results:
   * pattern + product 79,5% final test accuracy
   * pattern 90% final test accuracy
   * product 72,2% final test accuracy
11. Checked the pictures in my folder "to_check" - results for "pattern" model were the worst. There were not great differences between "pattern+product" and "product" results. The product results were slightly better, but I had only one picture from each decor to check
12. Downloaded some picture from the Internet to check my network
13. Decided to choose the model with "pattern+product":
   * there are more pictures to train the network
   * there were no great differences between the models when I was checking the resulst on my selected pictures
   * final test accuracy was better
14. Retrained the network without the step limit (default 4000 iterations) - final test accuracy was also 79,5%. 
15. Watched the charts from TensorBoard
